## Multiple Report Formats

**Problem:** Current report is one-size-fits-all. Some users want quick insights, others want deep analysis.

**Solution:** Two modes:
1. **Full Report** — Current War Room Debrief format
2. **TL;DR Mode** — Snappy, digestible summary
   - Toggle button to switch between them
   - Same data, different presentation

---

## Conditional Follow-ups Based on Score

**Trigger:** When idea scores ≥ 8/10 OR verdict is "PASS" / "CONDITIONAL_PASS"

**Offer follow-up actions:**
- 📊 Generate Pitch Deck
- 📋 Create Business Plan
- 🔄 Adjustments to Strategy
- 📅 Validation Plan

**UX:** After report loads, show contextual CTA based on verdict:
- PASS → "Ready to build? Generate your pitch deck"
- CONDITIONAL → "Address the risks first. Generate adjustment plan"
- FAIL → "Pivot needed. Explore alternatives"

## Export Possibilities

1. **PDF Export** — Professional document for sharing
2. **Export Plans** — Business plan, validation plan as standalone docs
3. **Clawdbot Skills Export** — Turn the validated idea into an agent skill that can help build it

## Questions for Later

- What threshold exactly triggers follow-ups? (8/10? Or verdict-based?)
- Should TL;DR be default or full report?
- What's the pricing model for premium exports?
- Clawdbot skill export — what would that look like exactly?
